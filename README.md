# UNIFIED_MENTOR_PROJECTS
This repository contains projects that I completed during the DATA SCIENCE internship with UNIFIED MENTOR. The dataset is being given by 'UNIFIED MENTOR' for using in the project.

**PROJECT 1** CLIMATE CHANGE MODELLING
**Climate Change Modelling** is a data science project aimed at analyzing climate trends and predicting future scenarios.
Libraries used:
pandas, numpy for data manipulation and preprocessing
scikit-learn for building and evaluating ML models
matplotlib, seaborn for visualizations


**PROJECT 2** CUSTOMER SATISFACTION PREDICTION
**Customer Satisfaction Prediction** is a data science project focused on analyzing customer feedback to predict satisfaction levels.
Libraries used:
pandas, numpy for data manipulation and preprocessing
scikit-learn, xgboost for model building and evaluation
matplotlib, seaborn for data visualization


This repository showcases two impactful data science projects tackling real-world challenges: Climate Change Modelling and Customer Satisfaction Prediction.
Both projects demonstrate the power of data-driven insights, leveraging machine learning and data visualization techniques.
From understanding global climate trends to predicting customer satisfaction, the models provide actionable outcomes.
These projects highlight the versatility of data science in solving diverse problems and can be extended further for real-time applications or deeper analysis.
